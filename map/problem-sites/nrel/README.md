### Station Locator Widget Issues

1. The station-locator widget overwrites other hash values when auto-refreshing the URL on the initial load.  
An extra slash is inserted after the # symbol.  
Example: watch the existing hash values disappear here when hitting refresh:  <a href="../nrel/#show=vehicles">Attempt to include local site's hash value</a>


2. Margins are need in footer to the left of "iPhone App" and to the right of "Alternative Fuels Data Center"  

3. NREL Station Locator site managers have not responded to corrections submitted for two points residing outside of Georgia.
